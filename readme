So i've always been passionate about e-commerce which includes the implementation of payment 
gateways and their APIs for easy and extensive use. After using paystack on my first payment
gateway project i decided to try an alternatve and yea Flutterave is really good and i like
it.

The thing i like about what Flutterwave did was it's similarity to paystack so it is easy
to use and other really easy to use extended features which i'd advise you try them out 
yourself.

1) I created a Flutterwave account.
2) Used the inline pop up api script
3) added images from www.unsplash.com

Viola and that's it -> hosted it on netlify https://my-flutterwave-api-test.netlify.app/

Have  nice day..and yeah, i'm having fun s a developer now
